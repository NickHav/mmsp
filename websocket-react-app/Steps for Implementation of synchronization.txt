Steps for Implementation of users joining the room and synchronization of the video state.

User Requests to Join the Room:

The participant sends a WebSocket request to the server to join the room.
The server puts the participant on hold and initiates the synchronization process.
Server Sends Pause Request to All Users:

The server sends a pause message to all users in the room, including the creator.
The message includes the creator's current video timestamp to ensure everyone synchronizes to the same point.
Users Acknowledge Pause:

Each user pauses their video and synchronizes with the creator's timestamp.
Once paused, users send a synchronized message back to the server, confirming they are ready.
Participant Joins and Synchronizes:

Once all users have acknowledged the pause, the server sends the current room state (including the video timestamp and chat history) to the new participant.
The participant synchronizes their video state with the creator's timestamp.
Creator Resumes Playback:

After the new participant has joined and synchronized, the creator regains control of the video.
The creator can press play, and the server broadcasts the play message to all users, resuming the video for everyone.
Extra Notes
Disable Video Controls During Synchronization:

While synchronization is in progress, all users (including the creator) should have their video controls disabled to prevent interference.
Timeout Mechanism:

To handle edge cases (e.g., a user fails to acknowledge the pause), the server should implement a timeout. If a user does not respond within a certain time, the server proceeds with the synchronization for the responsive users.
Error Handling:

If a user disconnects or fails to synchronize, the server should handle this gracefully (e.g., notify the remaining users and proceed with synchronization).
Scalability:

For larger rooms, ensure the server can handle multiple simultaneous synchronization requests efficiently.
Benefits of This Approach
Consistency:

Ensures all users are synchronized to the same video state before playback resumes.
Control:

The creator remains the sole controller of the video, maintaining a single source of truth for the video state.
User Experience:

Prevents desynchronization issues and ensures a seamless experience for all participants.
Potential Challenges
Latency:

Network delays could cause slight variations in when users pause or synchronize their videos.
Disconnected Users:

If a user disconnects during synchronization, the server needs to handle this without disrupting the process for others.
Edge Cases:

Users joining or leaving the room during synchronization need to be handled carefully to avoid inconsistencies.
